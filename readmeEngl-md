Writing Adventure DemusOpalium

Writing Adventure DemusOpalium is an open‑source typing game where you tackle exciting writing challenges in variable time modes (1–5 minutes) – whether you're being creative, precise, or under intense pressure! The game is primarily designed for PC users with a keyboard, but it also offers a fully responsive version for mobile devices.

Main Features and Game Modes

Multiple Game Modes:

    Freewrite: Creative writing without penalty.

    Hardcore: Every mistake or period of inactivity deletes your text.

    Adventure: Face off against the “Word Boss” and battle using your typed words.

    Copy Challenge: Type given sentences exactly as shown – thanks to improved logic, the game reliably starts with the Enter key, and new sentences are always generated upon reset.

    Creative Mode: Enjoy inspiring writing prompts to boost your creativity.

Reward System & Achievements:

    Unlock achievements when you hit specific milestones (for example, reaching a certain word count).

    Earn rewards and badges (such as special emoji rewards, font colors, etc.) that you can purchase in the shop.

Shop & Inventory:

    Buy cosmetic upgrades like new profile images, charms, and other icons using your earned Knowledge Points.

    The system’s display and usability have been improved – icons and buttons are optimized for both PC and mobile devices.

Profile Security:

    To prevent tampering (e.g., by directly editing the JSON file), a simple checksum (based on your Knowledge Points plus a secret key) is generated and saved when you save your profile.

    When loading your profile, this checksum is verified – any discrepancies are flagged as potential cheating.

    Important: We have enhanced the checksum mechanism so that all relevant values (such as your inventory of charms) are now taken into account.

Copy Challenge Optimizations:

    Improved logic for copy messages: the game now reliably starts with the Enter key when the start prompt appears in the text input field.

    The reset issue in Copy Mode has been fixed – new sentences are always generated.

New Features and Enhancements

Profile Name Change:
Previously, there was no way to change your profile name. Now, an input field and a button have been integrated so you can update your name directly in the game – the change is immediately reflected in your profile area.

Terminology Adjustments:

    “Credits” have been renamed to “Knowledge Points.”

    “Cursors” have been replaced by “Charms” – with all related variables, shop items, and display elements updated accordingly.

New "Code/Python" Category:
We have introduced an exciting new category that features a large collection of Python code examples:

    Easy (25 examples): Basic commands, variable assignments, loops, and simple outputs.

    Normal (15 examples): Functions, conditions, list comprehensions, file operations, and classes.

    Hard (10 examples): Challenging examples such as merge sort, DataFrame operations, decorators, the singleton pattern, asynchronous programming, and generators – presented humorously and clearly.

Technical Background and Motivation

After 17 years of intensive typing experience and experimenting with my new HotSwap 60%-keyboard – complete with a cork-dampened base – I asked myself: How fast can I really type? While searching for a suitable tool, I discovered “Write or Die,” which, however, is no longer actively developed. Other solutions often required an elaborate registration process – something that didn’t appeal to me. Writing Adventure DemusOpalium was thus created as an open, flexible platform to combine the fun of writing with a reward system and various challenges.

Platforms and Usage

PC (Keyboard):
The main focus is on the PC version, which makes full use of the keyboard and mouse. All game modes, the reward system, the shop, and profile management are optimized for PC.

Mobile Version:
A fully responsive version ensures that you can play the game seamlessly on smartphones – perfect for on-the-go use, even though the main focus remains on the PC.

When you finish a session, a score is calculated based on the number of words written, typing speed (WPM), errors, and additional bonuses. Accordingly, you earn Knowledge Points that can be spent in the shop – and extra rewards are given when you level up.

Open Source & Community

The entire code is open source and serves as a foundation for further improvements and enhancements. We welcome feedback, bug reports, and community contributions!

Special Thanks:
This project was developed in close collaboration with an amazing AI that continually provides creative ideas and helps us create outstanding code together. A big thank you for this inspiring support!

Thank you for trying out Writing Adventure DemusOpalium – have fun writing, typing, and discovering all the new features!
